interupt instruction
int arg
example 
int 0x0A ; CALLS INERRUPT 10

Types of interrupts
Hardware interrupt
Software interrupt
Exceptions

Hardware interrupts are triggered by hardware devices.
when you type on your keyboard the key triggers a hardware interrupt.
The processor stops what its doing to execute the code that handles
the keyboards input.
typically reading the key you've pressed into a buffer in memory.
their interrupts are asynchonous, meaning their occurrence is unrelated to the
Instructions being executed at the time they're raised.

Software interrupts
there are a series of software interruptsvthat are used to transfer control to
a function in the OS kernal.
software interrupts are triggered by the instruction int.
for example:
int 14h 
;triggers the interrupt 0x14.
the procssor stops the current program, and jumps to the code to handle the interrupt 14.
